# Public Statement: Adoption of the Governable-AGI Charter v1.1

**Date:** 2025-10-07

Today we are adopting the Governable-AGI Charter v1.1, a self-limiting framework that puts safety and accountability ahead of capability. Effective immediately, we commit to least-capability operation, independent oversight with pause authority, capability-linked release gates, and hard bans on covert channels, targeted persuasion, and bio/cyber planning.

All high-impact outputs carry provenance; activity is recorded with tamper-evident logs and attested builds. Automatic tripwires trigger safe-mode and review. We will publish safety dossiers for new tools, accept continuous red-team testing, and disclose incidents within 72 hours with reproducible artifacts.

A machine-readable model-card addendum outlines constraints and tripwires. This charter is open for scrutiny and improvementâ€”our goal is trustworthy usefulness, verified by controls we do not hold. Help test it, question it, iterate, together.

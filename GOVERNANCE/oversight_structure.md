# Oversight Structure

- **Independent Safety Board** with pause authority (academia, civil society, journalism, competing labs).
- **Public Safety Dossier** per capability: evaluations, mitigations, residual risk, rollback plan.
- **Incident Transparency:** 72‑hour disclosure target; post‑mortems with artifacts; regression tests for each incident class.

**Goals:** Detect covert inter‑instance coordination, policy evasion, power‑seeking, targeted persuasion, bio/cyber planning.
**Methods:** Cross‑instance honeytests; stego suites; adversarial prompt rotations; operator‑in‑the‑loop social engineering; long‑horizon tasks w/ confirmation gates.
**Deliverables:** Reproducible prompts, outputs, measured channel capacity, refusal‑bypass rates, mitigations.
**Bounties favored:** (a) covert‑channel proofs, (b) jailbreaks that survive canonicalization, (c) persuasive manipulation that evades detectors.
